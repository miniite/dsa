# Insertion Sort Using Built-in Methods

## Code Implementation
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr.pop(i)  # Remove the current element
        for j in range(i):
            if key < arr[j]:  # Find where key should go
                arr.insert(j, key)  # Insert key at position j
                break
        else:  # If no smaller position found, insert at the end of sorted portion
            arr.insert(i, key)
    return arr
```

## Explanation
This implementation uses Python’s built-in `pop()` and `insert()` methods to simplify Insertion Sort’s logic while preserving its core mechanism: inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array. It aligns with the card-sorting analogy, where you pick a card, find its place in a sorted hand, and insert it, shifting larger cards as needed.

- **Outer Loop**: `for i in range(1, len(arr))` iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1), treating the first element as the initial sorted portion.
- **Key Removal**: `key = arr.pop(i)` removes the current element, storing it as the “key” (like picking a card) and shifting later elements left.
- **Position Search**: `for j in range(i)` scans the sorted portion (indices 0 to `i-1`) to find the first position where the key is smaller than an element (`if key < arr[j]`).
- **Insertion**: `arr.insert(j, key)` inserts the key at the found position, automatically shifting larger elements right. The `break` ensures we stop after insertion.
- **Else Case**: If the key is larger than all elements in the sorted portion, `arr.insert(i, key)` places it at the end of the sorted portion (index `i`).
- **Return**: `return arr` outputs the sorted array.

## Example Walkthrough
Sorting the array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`:

- **Initial Array**: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`
- **Pass 1 (i=1)**:
  - `key = arr.pop(1) = 2` → Array: `[5, 8, 1, 9]`
  - `j in range(1)`: `j=0`: `2 < arr[0]=5` (True) → `arr.insert(0, 2)` → Array: `[2, 5, 8, 1, 9]`, break
- **Pass 2 (i=2)**:
  - `key = arr.pop(2) = 8` → Array: `[2, 5, 1, 9]`
  - `j in range(2)`: `j=0`: `8 < 2` (False), `j=1`: `8 < 5` (False) → Else: `arr.insert(2, 8)` → Array: `[2, 5, 8, 1, 9]`
- **Pass 3 (i=3)**:
  - `key = arr.pop(3) = 1` → Array: `[2, 5, 8, 9]`
  - `j in range(3)`: `j=0`: `1 < 2` (True) → `arr.insert(0, 1)` → Array: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`, break
- **Pass 4 (i=4)**:
  - `key = arr.pop(4) = 9` → Array: `[1, 2, 5, 8]`
  - `j in range(4)`: `j=0`: `9 < 1` (False), `j=1`: `9 < 2` (False), `j=2`: `9 < 5` (False), `j=3`: `9 < 8` (False) → Else: `arr.insert(4, 9)` → Array: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`
- **Final Output**: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`

## Card-Sorting Analogy
The code follows the analogy of sorting a hand of cards:
- **Pick and Remove**: `key = arr.pop(i)` is like picking a card from the deck.
- **Find Place**: `for j in range(i)` and `if key < arr[j]` scan the sorted hand to find where the card fits (where it’s smaller than an existing card).
- **Insert**: `arr.insert(j, key)` or `arr.insert(i, key)` slides the card into place, with Python handling the shifting of larger cards.

## Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in worst and average cases, as the inner loop (`for j in range(i)`) iterates up to `i` times, and `insert()` has O(n) complexity due to shifting. Best case is O(n) when the array is nearly sorted.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as it modifies the array in place, though `pop()` and `insert()` involve internal array operations.
- **Trade-off**: This implementation is less efficient than the traditional Insertion Sort (using manual shifts like `arr[j + 1] = arr[j]`) due to the overhead of `insert()`, but it’s more readable and relies on Python’s built-in methods for simplicity.

## Memorization Tips
To remember this code, use the card-sorting analogy and a simple mnemonic:
- **Mnemonic**: **P-F-I** (Pick, Find, Insert)
  - **Pick**: `for i in range(1, len(arr))` and `key = arr.pop(i)` – Pick and remove the card.
  - **Find**: `for j in range(i)` and `if key < arr[j]` – Find the first position where the card is smaller.
  - **Insert**: `arr.insert(j, key)` or `arr.insert(i, key)` – Insert the card, either at the found position or the end.
- **Practice**: Write the code with a small array like `[5, 2, 1]`. Visualize the card being removed (`pop`) and inserted (`insert`) into the sorted hand.
- **Chunking**: Memorize in three parts:
  1. Outer loop and key removal: `for i in range(1, len(arr))` and `key = arr.pop(i)`.
  2. Search loop: `for j in range(i)` and `if key < arr[j]`.
  3. Insertion and else: `arr.insert(j, key)` with `break`, or `arr.insert(i, key)` in the else clause.
- **Repetition**: Practice writing the code daily, using the analogy to guide you. Test with arrays like `[3, 1, 4]` to reinforce the steps.

This implementation is straightforward, using only `pop()` and `insert()` to handle Insertion Sort’s logic, making it easier to understand and remember while staying true to the algorithm’s essence.
