# To Find all Indices of a Target Element in a Sorted List with Duplicates using Binary Search

To find all indices of a target element in a sorted list with duplicates using binary search, you can leverage the `binary_search_first` and `binary_search_last` functions from the previous response. These functions identify the first and last occurrences of the target element, and you can then collect all indices in that range. Below, I’ll explain how to modify the binary search approach to return a list of all indices where the target element appears, provide the implementation, and include a detailed explanation tailored to your original binary search code.

## **Problem Context**

Given a sorted list (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`) and a target element (e.g., `2`), the goal is to return a list of all indices where the target appears (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`). Since the list is sorted, all occurrences of the target are contiguous, allowing us to use the first and last indices to generate the full list efficiently.

---

## **Approach**

1. **Use Binary Search to Find Boundaries**:
   - Use `binary_search_first` to find the index of the first occurrence of the target.
   - Use `binary_search_last` to find the index of the last occurrence.
   - If the first index is `-1` (target not found), return an empty list.

2. **Generate the List of Indices**:
   - If the first and last indices are valid, create a list of all integers from `first` to `last` (inclusive).

3. **Maintain Efficiency**:
   - The binary search for first and last occurrences each takes O(log n) time.
   - Generating the list of indices takes O(k) time, where `k` is the number of occurrences.
   - Total time complexity is O(log n + k), which is efficient since binary search minimizes the search effort, and listing indices is proportional to the output size.

## **Implementation**

Below is the complete code, building on the best practices from your original binary search implementation (using `mid = start + (end - start) // 2`) and the duplicate-handling functions from the previous response. The new function `binary_search_all_indices` returns a list of all indices where the target element appears.

```python
from typing import List

def binary_search_first(coll: List[int], ele: int) -> int:

    if not coll:
        return -1
    start = 0
    end = len(coll) - 1
    result = -1
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if coll[mid] == ele:
            result = mid
            end = mid - 1
        elif coll[mid] > ele:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1
    
    return result


def binary_search_last(coll: List[int], ele: int) -> int:
    if not coll
        return -1
    start = 0
    end = len(coll) - 1
    result = -1
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if coll[mid] == ele:
            result = mid
            start = mid + 1
        elif coll[mid] > ele:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1
    
    return result



def binary_search_all_indices(coll: List[int], ele: int) -> List[int]:
    first = binary_search_first(coll, ele)
    if first == -1:
        return []
    last = binary_search_last(coll, ele)
    return list(range(first, last + 1))



# Example usage
def main():
    coll = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    ele = 2
    indices = binary_search_all_indices(coll, ele)
    print(f"All indices of {ele} in {coll}: {indices}")  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
    
    # Additional test cases
    test_cases = [
        ([1, 2, 3, 4], 3),        # Single occurrence
        ([1, 1, 1, 1], 1),        # All elements same
        ([1, 2, 3], 4),           # Element not present
        ([], 5),                   # Empty list
        ([2], 2),                  # Single element
    ]
    
    for coll, ele in test_cases:
        indices = binary_search_all_indices(coll, ele)
        print(f"All indices of {ele} in {coll}: {indices}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## **Output**

Running the `main` function produces:

```
All indices of 2 in [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]: [1, 2, 3]
All indices of 3 in [1, 2, 3, 4]: [2]
All indices of 1 in [1, 1, 1, 1]: [0, 1, 2, 3]
All indices of 4 in [1, 2, 3]: []
All indices of 5 in []: []
All indices of 2 in [2]: [0]
```

## **Explanation**

### **How It Works**
1. **Find First Occurrence**:
   - `binary_search_first` searches for the leftmost index where `ele` appears by continuing to search the left half (`end = mid - 1`) when a match is found.
   - It stores the potential index in `result` and updates it if an earlier occurrence is found.

2. **Find Last Occurrence**:
   - `binary_search_last` searches for the rightmost index by continuing to search the right half (`start = mid + 1`) when a match is found.
   - It updates `result` with the latest match found.

3. **Generate All Indices**:
   - `binary_search_all_indices` uses the first and last indices to create a list using `range(first, last + 1)`.
   - If `first == -1`, the element isn’t in the list, so an empty list is returned.
   - Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, and `range` efficiently lists all indices.

### **Why Use Binary Search?**
- A naive linear scan to find all indices would take O(n) time, which is inefficient for large lists.
- Using binary search to find the first and last occurrences takes O(log n) time, and listing the indices takes O(k) time, where `k` is the number of occurrences. This is optimal for sorted lists.

### **Key Features**
- **Safe Midpoint Calculation**: Uses `mid = start + (end - start) // 2` to avoid potential integer overflow in languages with fixed-size integers, as discussed previously.
- **Input Validation**: Checks for empty lists to prevent errors.
- **Type Hints and Documentation**: Improves code readability and maintainability.
- **Efficiency**: O(log n) for finding boundaries, O(k) for listing indices, where `k` is the number of occurrences.

---

## **Edge Cases Handled**
- **Empty list**: Returns `[]` (handled by `first == -1`).
- **Single element**: Returns `[0]` if the element matches, `[]` otherwise.
- **No duplicates**: First and last indices are the same, returning a single-index list.
- **All elements same**: Returns all indices (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]` for `[1, 1, 1, 1]`).
- **Element not present**: Returns `[]`.

---

## **Performance**
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Finding first occurrence: O(log n)
  - Finding last occurrence: O(log n)
  - Generating indices: O(k), where `k` is the number of occurrences
  - Total: O(log n + k)
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1) for the binary search (excluding output)
  - O(k) for the output list of indices

---

## **Applications**
- **Range Queries**: Identify all positions of a value in a sorted dataset.
- **Data Analysis**: Find all occurrences for frequency or pattern analysis.
- **Algorithm Design**: Useful in problems like finding the range of valid indices in sorted arrays or implementing features like autocomplete with multiple matches.

## **Alternative Approach (If Needed)**
If you need to collect indices during the binary search process (instead of using `range`), you could modify the algorithm to explore both left and right halves when a match is found. However, this would increase the time complexity to O(n) in the worst case (e.g., when all elements are the same), making it less efficient than the first/last approach for sorted lists. The `range`-based approach is preferred because it leverages the sorted property to ensure contiguous indices.

---

## **Summary**
To find all indices of a target element in a sorted list with duplicates:
1. Use binary search to find the first occurrence (O(log n)).
2. Use binary search to find the last occurrence (O(log n)).
3. Generate a list of all indices in the range `[first, last]` (O(k)).
The provided implementation is efficient, robust, and incorporates best practices like safe midpoint calculation and input validation. It handles all edge cases and maintains the O(log n + k) time complexity, making it suitable for large sorted lists with duplicates.
